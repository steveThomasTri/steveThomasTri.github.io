                        <p class="paragraph">With the data to be trained and tested and keeping our question in mind, we
                            would want a classification model. For this model, we will be using decision trees inside
                            xgboost. We have 8 features from the data and one target feature. In notebook 3, we will run
                            the model without any changes to see what our accuracy is. After the model has been ran, we
                            have an accuracy of 69.60%. Which is ok, but I think that we can do better. The next thing
                            that we will do is to predict the 2019 NFL draft with draftsite.com to see where the
                            differences are. We have scraped the results of the 2019 NFL combine and we ended up with
                            309 people to test, with our assumptions of competing in at least one event. However it is
                            important to know that none of the positions are taken into consideration. Everyone is
                            treated equally.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">It is important to know in notebook 3 that We have kept in mind the
                            question at hand and the positions that are considered in this years combine. We dropped
                            rows that had positions of NT (nose tackle), K (kicker), and LS (long snapper), because
                            those positions are not considered in our testing data, we can drop those positions. The
                            model that was put forth in this notebook was a position neutral model. We dropped the year,
                            name, college, and position to test our features. For future model testing, it is imperative
                            that we use the same seed and test_sizes for all models. Later on, we will go over the many
                            different parameters that we will tune, but for now, let's get our first predictions.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">We will use the data from the data folder called <a
                                href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/data/2019TestingData.csv">2019Testingdata.csv</a>.
                            Before we get to the predictions, how did we get the data for this file?</p>

                        <h2>How I compiled the data for testing</h2>

                        <p class="paragraph">Observe the notebook in the repository called <a
                                href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/Obtaining%20the%20Combine%20Results.ipynb">Obtaining
                                the Combine Results</a>, We used the splinter dependency to obtain the combine results
                            from the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/combine/">Official NFL Combine Site</a>. We have to
                            navigate to each event as there is no page with all of the stats. We get the names of all
                            the people in the combine, then another for loop gets the stats from each event. Splinter
                            searches for a next button and scrapes the results, if it finds the next button, splinter
                            gets the results, if not, splinter moves on to select the next event. After all events are
                            put in a dataframe, all empty cells will be replaced with np.nan. Then we have to turn
                            columns of the dataframe into numeric. The last step is to remove all of the rows that an
                            athlete participated in none of the 6 events. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">The next website I went to get the current stats is the CBS Sports prospect
                            rankings to get the stats on each player. <em>If I had to do this again, the NFL combine
                                site had all of the players including the college, conference, arm length, and hand
                                length. We may analyze different conferences to determine if some conferences are
                                considered moreso over others. Also, the arm length and the hang length might have
                                determined if players get picked often.</em> Once we got all of the data, we stored the
                            data in two files. First, testcombine2019.csv and prospectinfo.csv. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Then I combined both files using the <a
                                href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/combining%20data.ipynb">combining
                                data </a> notebook by merging both files. Some column names were changed to reflect the
                            events of the combine. Also for the height, I converted it to inches. Through Microsoft
                            Excel, I rearranged the columns and resaved the 2019Testingdata.csv file. </p>

                        <p class='paragraph'>Going back to the Model testing notebook, we will be using the
                            2019TestingData.csv file to make our predictions. I extracted the name and the position and
                            dropped the columns only leaving the 8 features to pass through the model. I created a new
                            dataframe that will list the predictions from my model as well as other predictions from
                            other websites. I just wanted to compart my predictions from other sites. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">As of April 4, 2019, We have done the predictions and compared them to the
                            <a href="https://www.draftsite.com/nfl/mock-draft/2019/v23/">version 23</a> of draftsite.com
                            mock draft to see how we matched up with that site. Out of the 32 players drafted in the
                            first round, 3 people were not considered because they didn't take part in any of the 6
                            events. The list of people are:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Kyler Murray</li>
                            <li>Josh Jacobs</li>
                            <li>Nasir Adderly</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="paragraph">Our model has 27 out of 29 players drafted. The two misses were Dwayne
                            Haskins and Cody Ford. One of the questions that I have is that my model fails to draft
                            Dwayne Haskins and Cody Ford. Why is this? We may be able to answer the question at a later
                            point. This is great, however
                            there is the possibility of false positives here. The predictions are airing on the side of
                            more people being drafted. So there needs to be a process to change the parameters and why
                            are we changing them.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Something to note for the record. Observe <a
                                href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/5%20Observing%20False%20Positives.ipynb">5
                                Observing False Positives</a> and notice the accuracy. We got a 70.21% accuracy and the
                            reason we obtain this is that previously, we deleted rows with NT, LS, and K. This model is
                            position neutral, so we shouldn't delete those rows. However, my thinking was flawed and
                            deleting these rows will be done for later models. I restarted the process with the new
                            model and the model predicted that 252 players will be drafted this year. This is very
                            unlikely, because the NFL drafts 256 players every year and as we observed, players that
                            didn't participate in one event were still drafted, so there will be false positives in the
                            model. However, I would like to reduce the false positives. What I didn't consider before my
                            data science instructor brought this up is different positions require different
                            skills. In my first model, a quarterback is on the same level as a defensive tackle, and
                            this doesn't make any sense. A quarterback uses speed to get away from defenders, while a
                            defensive tackle uses strength to power through the offensive linemen. And so, the process
                            begins on thinking differently. </p>
