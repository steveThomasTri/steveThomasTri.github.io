                        <p class="paragraph">Approximately two months ago, I was and still am fascinated about the world
                            of machine learning. I had looked through tutorials about using the MNIST data set to
                            predict numbers, classes of flowers, whether a picture was a muffin or a puppy. Going
                            through these tutorials I had no problem in trying to set up a neural network or a decision
                            tree or a logistic regression. However, the concept that was not clear to me was if you have
                            set up a model with a certain accuracy, how do you then improve on that accuracy? </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Then I went into exploring machine learning packages from python that you
                            can use. Many packages are out there like sci-kit learn, tensorflow, keras, xgboost, etc. I
                            knew that I wanted to do a classification problem, basically answering a Yes or No question,
                            but which one would I want to do? What problem was most interesting to me?</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">A little background experience of the python technologies that I have used.
                            I used BeautifulSoup, selenium/splinter for automation, flask for backend development. For
                            data visualization, jupyter notebook, pandas, matplotlib. For machine learning, keras,
                            sci-kit learn, tensorflow. It was time to put these to use and see if I can find a problem
                            and attempt to solve. In our class, there was a lot of football talk about the Cleveland
                            Browns this year and how they could be a playoff team. So I was thinking, how team select
                            players and what is the process that prospects go through. There are "analysts" and
                            "experts" that predict where would players go, when would they go off the board in a draft,
                            what round are they picked. Although these questions are great for an advanced model, I just
                            want to predict whether a player would get drafted. And so, the data science problem was
                            stated.</p>

                        <h4 class="border border-success p-md-2"><strong>Based on an NFL draft prospects height, weight,
                                and the results that they posted in the NFL combine, will this person be
                                drafted?</strong></h4>

                        <p class="paragraph">As you read through this article, pay special attention to green boxes,
                            because over the course of two months, the main question changes as I learn new methods and
                            ways to represent the data. Now that I have the question at hand, how would we retrieve the
                            data?</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Before we get into the data acquisition, A word on how the draft works. In
                            late April, for three days, Americans are glued to watch which players will be drafted to
                            which teams. Usually day 1 has the most talented prospects and that generates the most buzz.
                            Day 2 consists of rounds 2 and 3. The conclusion of the draft is day 3 for rounds 4 to 7.
                            There are 32 teams in the NFL and each team gets a pick for each round. A total of 224
                            people are drafted plus 32 additional picks for a total of 256 players that are drafted.
                            These picks are compulsory unless they trade. For further reading on how the draft works
                            with the twists and turns, read the NFL's article titled <a
                                href="https://operations.nfl.com/the-players/the-nfl-draft/the-rules-of-the-draft/">The
                                Rules of the draft</a></p>

                        <p class="paragraph">But what is a draft without prospects. That is where coaches get a look at
                            how athletic each prospect is. How well they interview with coaches. How well they test and
                            other factors. Two months earlier, 338 prospects were invited to Indianapolis. The link of
                            all of the invitees is <a
                                href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2019-nfl-draft-full-list-of-338-prospects-invited-to-nfl-scouting-combine-including-kyler-murray/">here</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Most of the prospects will compete in at least one of 6 testing events in
                            the combine:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bench Press - The weights are set at 225 lbs. and the person has to do as many reps as
                                possible. This is an indicator of their strength. </li>
                            <li>Vertical Leap - The prospect starts standing, they will jump as high as they can to slap
                                a wall. This is an indicator of their lower body strength and power</li>
                            <li>Broad Jump - The prospect starts flat footed and then they leap out in front. This is
                                an indicator of their lower body strength and power. </li>
                            <li>Three Cone Relay - The course is an L shaped. They will start at a cone, run to the
                                middle cone, run back to the start, then run around both cones before sprinting to the
                                start. This is an indicator of how a prospect can quickly shift directions at high
                                speed.</li>
                            <li>20 yard Shuttle Run - A prospect starts at a line, sprints 5 yards forward, sprints 10
                                yards back, and then sprints 5 yards forward to complete the run. This is an indicator
                                of the prospects ability to change direction and his lateral quickness.</li>
                            <li>40 yard dash - A prospect sprints down 40 yards as quick as possible. This is an
                                indication of their explosiveness, speed, burst, and acceleration. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="paragraph">This is the data that we will be testing once all of the models are
                            complete. We have our test data, but now we need data to train through data acquisition.

                            used on <a href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject.git">GitHub</a></p>
                        <p class="paragraph">In order to acquire the data that we would like to model, we needed to go
                            to two websites. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>nflcombineresults.com</li>
                            <li>drafthistory.com</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">The reason that we chose the first website is considering all other
                            websites at the time, this one seems to be the most comprehensive. Whilst
                            pro-football-reference had combine results that went back to 2000, The nflcombineresults.com
                            went all the way back to 1997. From the first jupyter notebook (1 Data Acquisition) we start
                            the process
                            of getting all of the combine results from 1997 – 2018. The reason that we went back to 1997
                            is because that year first introduced the 3 cone event. The website is nflcombineresults.com
                            – 32 years of NFL scouting Combine data is the website that we used to scrape the data from
                            splinter. After I got all of the combine data, I had to normalize the names column so that
                            the name is lower case and remove all punctuations marks so that when we compare the names
                            to whether they get drafted or not, the process would be easier. For this, we go to
                            drafthistory.com. Gather the list of names from 1997 - 2018 and then cross check them to the
                            nflcombinedata97to18.csv file. We would also like to
                            remove rows that didn’t post a score in any of the events. Our model assumes that a prospect
                            has competed in at least one event. So in this case, we will now revise our main question.

                        <h4 class="border border-success p-md-2"><strong>Having at least participated in one NFL combine
                                event, will a future prospect be drafted in the NFL?</strong></h4>

                        <p class="paragraph"><em>*A moment of retrospect* In gathering the data, you will notice that I
                                used splinter to gather all of the data for each year. If I had to do this process all
                                over again, It is much easier to use the pandas read_html function as it is much quicker
                                to get the data and then each year I can concatenate the dataframes. Also, there may
                                have been two key columns that were missing, hand size and arm length. These factors
                                could have affected any future models that I might have made.</em></p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Also, in 2015 the data accounted for 700 prospects in the NFL combine for
                            that year. This is caused to additional data being added for that year. We cannot tell the
                            reason as to why this occurred, but we cross-checked the number of combine participants for
                            2015 and most of the sources have the number at around 300 individuals. So well will need to
                            remove those rows that are not in the combine. We will be going to the <a
                                href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/2/6/7993765/nfl-combine-2015-invite-list">SB
                                Nation website</a>
                            that has the list of 2015 combine participants and search the dataframe to see if any
                            players do not make the list. If the name is not in the article, remove that row and only
                            search the rows with year 2015. In doing so, we have eliminated 451 rows giving a final 2015
                            total of 285 rows. Then we merged the
                            two dataframes by name and year to obtain a new dataset of 6300 rows.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">The drafthistory.com website provides us with the years of every NFL player
                            that has been
                            drafted. All that we are looking for is if the player is on the list, then we consider them
                            drafted. Going to the website, I used splinter to gather a list of each player. And those
                            players are stored in a dataframe called drafted. Storing the name, year, and a 1 for
                            drafted. Once I have this dataframe, I will merge this dataframe with the combine
                            information that I have previously made and merge it on the name and the year, because it is
                            possible that there may be players with the same name in different years. For the column
                            drafted, I changed the values of 1 to Y and 0 to N to get the final csv file with 6,300 rows
                            and 13 columns. The completed file is called cleaned_NFL_combine_97_to_2018.csv. We now have
                            the necessary data that has been cleaned, we will now go into analyzing our data and see
                            what we can learn and any trends that we can observe.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">As you can see, we get a good snapshot of what our data consists of. We
                            have missing values, but because the xgboost library handles these pretty well, we will
                            ignore these for now. The feature with the highest missing values is the 3 cone drill with
                            26.3%. I have read in some articles that if there are 50% missing values, that column should
                            be dropped. Other articles are in the range of 20-50%, depending on what you are trying to
                            model. Because each event is important for certain positions more so than the next and the
                            fact that he missing values fall short of the 50% threshold, we will keep all of the columns
                            and make a decision on whether to impute missing values or not. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">For 2 Data Analysis, I was looking for correlations of two variables. My
                            thought process at the time was that if I can find relationships between two variables, I
                            can best understand my data better. I have got the following strong correlations</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">In notebook <a href="#">2b Exploratory Data Analysis</a> I have also done
                            an analysis on each of the 6 events to see if there is anything else that I can learn from
                            my data. What I wanted to do is to see if there is a flag for certain data. For example, We
                            will look at the first table where I grouped by position and whether a person is drafted.
                            Wide Receivers need to be fast so it makes sense that we look at how they run the 40 yard
                            dash. People that were drafted had times between 4.21s and 4.76s. People that were not
                            drafted ran between 4.31s and 4.85 seconds. My thought was that any wide receivers that ran
                            less than 4.31 seconds would more likely get drafted and any wide receivers that ran slower
                            than 4.76 seconds were more likely to not be drafted. If the testing data shows that faster
                            than 4.31 seconds were drafted and slower than 4.76 seconds were not drafted, then I believe
                            that there was something there and coaches were looking at the times of the 40 yard, not to
                            say that other factors were considered, but the model might solely look at the 40 yard dash
                            for wide receivers. The notebooks analyze the data by position and whether or not they were
                            drafted is left in the notebook and I am open to what should I have explored further for
                            this data or if this is a fruitless endeavor. We have got to know our data a little bit
                            better, and now we will make our first attempt at modeling our data.</p>

                            xgboost. We have 8 features from the data and one target feature. In notebook 3, we will run
                            the model without any changes to see what our accuracy is. After the model has been ran, we
                            have an accuracy of 69.60%. Which is ok, but I think that we can do better. The next thing
                            that we will do is to predict the 2019 NFL draft with draftsite.com to see where the
                            differences are. We have scraped the results of the 2019 NFL combine and we ended up with
                            309 people to test, with our assumptions of competing in at least one event. However it is
                            important to know that none of the positions are taken into consideration. Everyone is
                            treated equally.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">It is important to know in notebook 3 that We have kept in mind the
                            question at hand and the positions that are considered in this years combine. We dropped
                            rows that had positions of NT (nose tackle), K (kicker), and LS (long snapper), because
                            those positions are not considered in our testing data, we can drop those positions. The
                            model that was put forth in this notebook was a position neutral model. We dropped the year,
                            name, college, and position to test our features. For future model testing, it is imperative
                            that we use the same seed and test_sizes for all models. Later on, we will go over the many
                            different parameters that we will tune, but for now, let's get our first predictions.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">We will use the data from the data folder called <a
                                href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/data/2019TestingData.csv">2019Testingdata.csv</a>.
                            Before we get to the predictions, how did we get the data for this file?</p>

                        <h2>How I compiled the data for testing</h2>

                        <p class="paragraph">Observe the notebook in the repository called <a
                                href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/Obtaining%20the%20Combine%20Results.ipynb">Obtaining
                                the Combine Results</a>, We used the splinter dependency to obtain the combine results
                            from the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/combine/">Official NFL Combine Site</a>. We have to
                            navigate to each event as there is no page with all of the stats. We get the names of all
                            the people in the combine, then another for loop gets the stats from each event. Splinter
                            searches for a next button and scrapes the results, if it finds the next button, splinter
                            gets the results, if not, splinter moves on to select the next event. After all events are
                            put in a dataframe, all empty cells will be replaced with np.nan. Then we have to turn
                            columns of the dataframe into numeric. The last step is to remove all of the rows that an
                            athlete participated in none of the 6 events. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">The next website I went to get the current stats is the CBS Sports prospect
                            rankings to get the stats on each player. <em>If I had to do this again, the NFL combine
                                site had all of the players including the college, conference, arm length, and hand
                                length. We may analyze different conferences to determine if some conferences are
                                considered moreso over others. Also, the arm length and the hang length might have
                                determined if players get picked often.</em> Once we got all of the data, we stored the
                            data in two files. First, testcombine2019.csv and prospectinfo.csv. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Then I combined both files using the <a
                                href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/combining%20data.ipynb">combining
                                data </a> notebook by merging both files. Some column names were changed to reflect the
                            events of the combine. Also for the height, I converted it to inches. Through Microsoft
                            Excel, I rearranged the columns and resaved the 2019Testingdata.csv file. </p>

                        <p class='paragraph'>Going back to the Model testing notebook, we will be using the
                            2019TestingData.csv file to make our predictions. I extracted the name and the position and
                            dropped the columns only leaving the 8 features to pass through the model. I created a new
                            dataframe that will list the predictions from my model as well as other predictions from
                            other websites. I just wanted to compart my predictions from other sites. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">As of April 4, 2019, We have done the predictions and compared them to the
                            <a href="https://www.draftsite.com/nfl/mock-draft/2019/v23/">version 23</a> of draftsite.com
                            mock draft to see how we matched up with that site. Out of the 32 players drafted in the
                            first round, 3 people were not considered because they didn't take part in any of the 6
                            events. The list of people are:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Kyler Murray</li>
                            <li>Josh Jacobs</li>
                            <li>Nasir Adderly</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="paragraph">Our model has 27 out of 29 players drafted. The two misses were Dwayne
                            Haskins and Cody Ford. One of the questions that I have is that my model fails to draft
                            Dwayne Haskins and Cody Ford. Why is this? We may be able to answer the question at a later
                            point. This is great, however
                            there is the possibility of false positives here. The predictions are airing on the side of
                            more people being drafted. So there needs to be a process to change the parameters and why
                            are we changing them.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Something to note for the record. Observe <a
                                href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/5%20Observing%20False%20Positives.ipynb">5
                                Observing False Positives</a> and notice the accuracy. We got a 70.21% accuracy and the
                            reason we obtain this is that previously, we deleted rows with NT, LS, and K. This model is
                            position neutral, so we shouldn't delete those rows. However, my thinking was flawed and
                            deleting these rows will be done for later models. I restarted the process with the new
                            model and the model predicted that 252 players will be drafted this year. This is very
                            unlikely, because the NFL drafts 256 players every year and as we observed, players that
                            didn't participate in one event were still drafted, so there will be false positives in the
                            model. However, I would like to reduce the false positives. What I didn't consider before my
                            data science instructor brought this up is different positions require different
                            skills. In my first model, a quarterback is on the same level as a defensive tackle, and
                            this doesn't make any sense. A quarterback uses speed to get away from defenders, while a
                            defensive tackle uses strength to power through the offensive linemen. And so, the process
                            begins on thinking differently. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Although in our first model we were able to get 70.21% accuracy, the
                            problem is that this model doesn't accurately represent what the coaches are looking for.
                            Because NFL teams need to fill different positions and different positions require different
                            attributes, the first model is not a fair representation of what is happening in the real
                            world. It is not enough to think about the measurements of a player, you also have to think
                            about the intangibles of that individual. You have to put on many hats as a data scientist,
                            such as in this case, a coach, a scout, a GM, an owner, etc. How do you measure leadership?
                            How do you evaluate how well they interview? What is their work ethic on and off the field?
                            More importantly, how would one quantify intangibles? For some of these intangibles, they
                            are not available to the public and thus it may be impossible to measure like interviews,
                            white board test, Wonderlic test. One word about the Wonderlic test is that some of these
                            scores are leaked to the public and we cannot verify the validity of these scores. Here is a
                            list of factors that were considered and not considered. Keep in mind that the items not
                            considered may not be an exhaustive list.</p>

                        <h5>Factors that I have considered:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prospect's height and weight</li>
                            <li>Prospect's measurements in the 6 events</li>
                            <li>Prospect's college stats</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h5>Factors that I have NOT considered:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prospect's arm length and hand length</li>
                            <li>Prospect's college and conference</li>
                            <li>Prospect's interviews, white board test, and Wonderlic test</li>
                            <li>How tough was their conference</li>
                            <li>Their grit (leadership, work ethic, toughness, football intelligence)</li>
                            <li>Different teams needs to fill certain positions</li>
                            <li>Any tapes that scouts looked at to assess their playing ability</li>
                            <li>And much more...</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class='paragraph'>There are other factors that were not considered and I have a list of two
                            articles that outline these intangibles. The first article is from <a
                                href='https://www.theringer.com/2018/4/12/17227604/nfl-draft-intangibles-scouting-evaluation'>The
                                Ringer</a> one year ago. This article outlines how scouts evaluate qualities like poise,
                            confidence, grit, etc. The second article is a starting point on how the <a
                                href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1686933-how-do-scouts-break-down-nfl-safety-prospects">Bleacher
                                Report</a> breaks down certain positions. The article starts off with what scouts look
                            for in a safety. There are more links in other positions if you are interested. There are
                            other articles out there, but these are the two main ones to get a general understanding on
                            other factors than just raw numbers. </p>

                        <p class='paragraph'>From suggestions that were given to me. I have decided that instead of one
                            model, I would have a model for each group. With each model, determine what combine events
                            are important in an attempt to reduce noise and make the models more of like what to look
                            for
                            in those positions. So starting from our 8 original features, let's see if there are some
                            features that we would like to add, or delete.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p class="paragraph"><strong>Feature Engineering</strong> is taking the data that you have
                            already to generate new features. Sometimes it is an attempt to explain features not
                            considered in the model. For example, the feature that we want to add is BMI (Body Mass
                            Index) we can use the prospect's height and weight to generate what their BMI is so that we
                            may be able to predict if someone is drafted. You can see that you can generate any number
                            of additional features based on the data you have, but the risk is that you are going to
                            introduce unnecessary noise to your model. Feature engineering is an art and a science, so
                            the only way to know what constitutes a good feature is by experience. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">What we will do is to categorize the data that we have into ten groups with
                            ten separate csvs. These ten categories are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Offensive Line (OL) consists of OT, OG, C, OL</li>
                            <li>Defensive Line (DL) consists of DT, DE, DL</li>
                            <li>Running Backs (RB) consists of RB, HB, FB</li>
                            <li>Line Backers (LB) consists of OLB, ILB, LB, DB</li>
                            <li>Tight Ends (TE)</li>
                            <li>Cornerbacks (CB)</li>
                            <li>Wide Receivers (WR)</li>
                            <li>Safety (S) consists of FS, SS</li>
                            <li>Quarterbacks (QB)</li>
                            <li>Punters (P)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">So let's revise our question:</p>
                        <h4 class="border border-success p-md-2"><strong>Based on an NFL draft prospects height, weight,
                                and the results that they posted in the NFL combine, will this person be
                                drafted if we group them by position?</strong></h4>
                        <p class="paragraph">So we get away from a position neutral model to a model based on a players
                            declared position in the combine. We start off separating each player in the training data
                            by the categories. We will be observing the data of each group. <a href=''>6 Splitting into
                                categories</a> is the notebook that makes those ten csvs in the TrainTest Folder. Within
                            the TrainTest folder, we make ten folders that coorespond to the groups. </p>

                        <p class='paragraph'>For each folder, there will be three notebooks and a csv file of training
                            data for that group. We will take the WR folder as an example as to how each group will be
                            formatted for the purposes of this article</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">So we will breakdown the two tables above. Starting from the left, Using
                            the original 8 features, we get the base accuracy and a possible accuracy if any of the 8
                            features are removed. The next line is any features that we will add. For different groups,
                            there will be certain featurs that make sense to add like wide receivers receiving yards,
                            touchdowns, that do not for a defense tackle. After we add more features, we run the model
                            again and this time we get the highest accuracy attainable if we do not do any feature
                            tuning and any features that we will remove.</p>

                        <p class='paragraph'>The second table is once we get the maximum accuracy, we will be doing
                            hyperparameter tuning to see if we can get the model to perform better. There are 6
                            parameters that we have considered tuning:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Learning Rate - In each step, as new data is taken in, the model will change how certain
                                features are weighed in each step. The larger the value, the more rows it learns
                                quickly.</li>
                            <li>n_estimators - Number of decision trees</li>
                            <li>Max Depth - How deep is each tree</li>
                            <li>Minimun Child Weight - A larger value makes the model more conservative</li>
                            <li>Gamma - Minimum loss reduction required to make further partitions on a leaf node of the
                                tree.</li>
                            <li>Colsample_bytree - subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class='paragraph'>For more information on each of these parameters, consult the
                            documentation. <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html">XGBoost

                        <p class="paragraph">Here is a breakdown of what each notebook was used for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first notebook establishes the model from the base configurations and finds the
                                maximum accuracy if the original 8 features are considered.</li>
                            <li>Part II Notebook uses splinter to obtain additional data based on the group. It goes
                                through each name and fills in the data and if they got awards. College stats are left
                                blank if none exists, but awards are always populated.</li>
                            <li>Part III notebook gets the base accuracy when we add features from part II. Then we find
                                the maximum accuracy if certain features are removed. Verify that removing those
                                features give us the maximum accuracy. Then we implement hyperparameter tuning using the
                                6 parameters through brute force. There are 14,400 different combinations to check for.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
