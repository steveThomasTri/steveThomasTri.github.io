                        <p class="paragraph">Approximately two months ago, I was and still am fascinated about the world
                            of machine learning. I had looked through tutorials about using the MNIST data set to
                            predict numbers, classes of flowers, whether a picture was a muffin or a puppy. Going
                            through these tutorials I had no problem in trying to set up a neural network or a decision
                            tree or a logistic regression. However, the concept that was not clear to me was if you have
                            set up a model with a certain accuracy, how do you then improve on that accuracy? </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Then I went into exploring machine learning packages from python that you
                            can use. Many packages are out there like sci-kit learn, tensorflow, keras, xgboost, etc. I
                            knew that I wanted to do a classification problem, basically answering a Yes or No question,
                            but which one would I want to do? What problem was most interesing to me?</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">A little backgroud experience of the python technologies that I have used.
                            I used BeautifulSoup, selenium/splinter for automation, flask for backend development. For
                            data visualization, jupyter notebook, pandas, matplotlib. For machine learning, keras,
                            sci-kit learn, tensorflow. It was time to put these to use and see if I can find a problem
                            and attempt to solve. In our class, there was a lot of football talk about the Cleveland
                            Browns this year and how they could be a playoff team. So I was thinking, how team select
                            players adn what is the process that prospects go through. There are "analysts" and
                            "experts" that predict where would players go, when would they go off the board in a draft,
                            what round are they picked. Although these questions are great for an advanced model, I just
                            want to predict whether a player would get drafted. And so, the data science problem was
                            stated.</p>

                        <h4 class="border border-success p-md-2"><strong>Based on an NFL draft prospects height, weight,
                                and the results that they posted in the NFL combine, will this person be

                        <p class="paragraph">As you read through this article, pay special attention to green boxes,
                            because over the course of two months, the main question changes as I learn new methods and
                            ways to represent the data. Now that I have the question at hand, how would we retrieve the
                            data?</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Before we get into the data acquisition, A word on how the draft works. In
                            late April, for three days, Americans are glued to watch which players will be drafted to
                            which teams. Usually day 1 has the most talented prospects and that generates the most buzz.
                            Day 2 consists of rounds 2 and 3. The conclusion of the draft is day 3 for rounds 4 to 7.
                            There are 32 teams in the NFL and each team gets a pick for each round. A total of 224
                            people are drafted plus 32 additional picks for a total of 256 players that are drafted.
                            This picks are compulsorary unless they trade. For further reading on how the draft works
                            with the twists and turns, read the NFL's article titled <a
                                href="https://operations.nfl.com/the-players/the-nfl-draft/the-rules-of-the-draft/">The
                                Rules of the draft</a></p>

                        <p class="paragraph">But what is a draft without prospects. That is where coaches get a look at
                            how athletic each prospect is. How well they interview with coaches. How well they test and
                            other factors. Two months earlier, 338 prospects were invited to Indianapolis. The link of
                            all of the invitees is <a
                                href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2019-nfl-draft-full-list-of-338-prospects-invited-to-nfl-scouting-combine-including-kyler-murray/">here</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Most of the prospects will compete in at least one of 6 testing events in
                            the combine:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bench Press - The weights are set at 225 lbs. and the person has to do as many reps as
                                possible. This is an indicator of their strength. </li>
                            <li>Vertical Leap - The prospect starts standing, they will jump as high as they can to slap
                                a wall. This is an indicator of their lower body strenght and power</li>
                            <li>Broad Jump - The prosepect starts flat footed and then they leap out in front. This is
                                an indicator of their lower body strength and power. </li>
                            <li>Three Cone Relay - The course is an L shaped. They will start at a cone, run to the
                                middle cone, run back to the start, then run around both cones before sprinting to the
                                start. This is an indicator of how a prospect can quickly shift directions at high
                                speed.</li>
                            <li>20 yard Shuttle Run - A prospect starts at a line, sprints 5 yards forward, sprints 10
                                yards back, and then sprints 5 yards forward to compolete the run. This is an indicator
                                of the prospects ability to change direction and his lateral quickness.</li>
                            <li>40 yard dash - A prospect sprints down 40 yards as quick as possible. This is an
                                indication of their explosivemenss, speed, burst, and acceleration. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="paragraph">This is the data that we will be testing once all of the models are
                            complete. We have our test data, but now we need data to train through data acquisition.

                        <p class="paragraph">You can find all of the jupyter notebooks and the csv files that I have
                            used on <a href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject.git">GitHub</a></p>
                        <p class="paragraph">In order to acquire the data that we would like to model, we needed to go
                            to two websites. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>nflcombineresults.com</li>
                            <li>drafthistory.com</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="paragraph">The reason that we chose the first website is considering all other
                            websites at the time, this one seems to be the most comprehensive. Whilst
                            pro-football-reference had combine results that went back to 2000, The nflcombineresults.com
                            went all the way back to 1997. From the first jupyter notebook (1 Data Acquisition) we start
                            the process
                            of getting all of the combine results from 1997 – 2018. The reason that we went back to 1997
                            is because that year first introduced the 3 cone event. The website is nflcombineresults.com
                            – 32 years of NFL scouting Combine data is the website that we used to scrape the data from
                            splinter. After I got all of the combine data, I had to normalize the names column so that
                            the name is lower case and remove all punctuations marks so that when we compare the names
                            to whether they get drafted or not, the process would be easier. For this, we go to
                            drafthistory.com. Gather the list of names from 1997 - 2018 and then cross check them to the
                            nflcombinedata97to18.csv file. We would also like to
                            remove rows that didn’t post a score in any of the events. Our model assumes that a prospect
                            has competed in at least one event. So in this case, we will now revise our main question.

                        <p class="paragraph"><em>*A moment of retrospect* In gathering the data, you will notice that I
                                used splinter to gather all of the data for each year. If I had to do this process all
                                over again, It is much easier to use the pandas read_html function as it is much quicker
                                to get the data and then each year i can concatenate the dataframes. Also, there may
                                have been two key columns that were missing, hand size and arm length. These factors
                                could have affected any future models that I might have made.</em></p>

                        <p class="paragraph">Also, in 2015 the data accounted for 700 prospects in the NFL combine for
                            that year. This is caused to additional data being added for that year. We cannot tell the
                            reason as to why this occurred, but we cross-checked the number of combine participants for
                            2015 and most of the sources have the number at around 300 individuals. So wel will need to
                            remove those rows that are not in the combine. We will be going to the <a
                                href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2015/2/6/7993765/nfl-combine-2015-invite-list">SB
                                Nation website</a>
                            that has the list of 2015 combine participants and search the dataframe to see if any
                            players do not make the list. If the name is not in the article, remove that row and only
                            search the rows with year 2015. In doing so, we have eliminated 451 rows giving a final 2015
                            total of 285 rows. Then we merged the
                            two dataframes by name and year to obtain a new dataset of 6300 rows.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">The drafthistory.com website provides us with the years of every NFL player
                            that has been
                            drafted. All that we are looking for is if the player is on the list, then we consider them
                            drafted. Going to the website, I used splinter to gather a list of each player. And those
                            players are stored in a dataframe called drafted. Storing the name, year, and a 1 for
                            drafted. Once I have this dataframe, I will merge this dataframe with eht combine
                            information that I have previously made and merge it on the name and the year, because it is
                            possible that there maybe players with the same name in different years. For the column
                            drafed, I changed the values of 1 to Y and 0 to N to get the final csv file with 6,300 rows
                            and 13 columns. The completed file is called cleaned_NFL_combine_97_to_2018.csv. We now have
                            the necessary data that has been cleaned, we will now go into analyzing our data and see
                            what we can learn and any trends that we can observe.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">As you can see, we get a good snapshot of what our data consists of. We
                            have missing values, but because the xgboost library handles these pretty well, we will
                            ignore these for now. The feature with the highest missing values is the 3 cone drill with
                            26.3%. I have read in some articles that if there are 50% missing values, that column should
                            be dropped. Other articles are in the range of 20-50%, depending on what you are trying to
                            model. Because each event is important for certain positions moreso than the next and the
                            fact that he missing values fall short of the 50% threshold, we will keep all of the columns
                            and make a decision on whether to impute missing values or not. </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">For 2 Data Analysis, I was looking for correlations of two variables. My
                            thought process at the time was that if i can find relationaships between two variables, I
                            can best understand my data better. I have got the following strong correlations</p>

                        </ul>

                        <p class="paragraph">In notebook <a href="#">2b Exploratory Data Analysis</a> I have also done
                            an analysis on each of the 6 events to see if there is anything else that I can learn from
                            my data. What I wanted to do is to see if there is a flag for certain data. For example, We
                            will look at the first table where i grouped by position and whether a person is drafted.
                            Wide Receivers need to be fast so it makes sense that we look at how they run the 40 yard
                            dash. People that were drafted had times between 4.21s and 4.76s. People that were not
                            drafted ran between 4.31s and 4.85 seconds. My thought was that any wide receivers that ran
                            less than 4.31 seconds would more likely get drafted and any wide receivers that ran slower
                            than 4.76 seconds were more likely to not be drafted. If the testing data shows that faster
                            than 4.31 seconds were drafted and slower than 4.76 seconds were not drafted, then I believe
                            that there was something there and coaches were looking at the times of the 40 yard, not to
                            say that other factors were considered, but the model might solely look at the 40 yard dash
                            for wide receivers. The notebooks analyze the data by position and whether or not they were
                            drafted is left in the notebook and I am open to what should I have explored further for
                            this data or if this is a fruitless endeavor. We have got to know our data a little bit
                            better, and now we will make our first attempt at modeling our data.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">With the data to be trained and tested and keeping our question in mind, we
                            would want a classification model. For this model, we will be using decision trees inside
                            xgboost. We have 8 features from the data and one target feature. In notebook 3, we will run
                            the model without any changes to see what our accuracy is. After the model has been ran, we
                            have an accuracy of 69.60%. Which is ok, but I think that we can do better. The next thing
                            that we will do is to predict the 2019 NFL draft with draftsite.com to see where the
                            differences are. We have scraped the results of the 2019 NFL combine and we ended up with
                            309 people to test, with aour assumptions of competing in at least one event. However it is
                            important to know that none of the positions are taken into consideration. Everyone is
                            treated equally.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">It is important to know in notebook 3 that We have kept in mind the question at hand and the positions that are considered in this years combine.  We dropped rows that had positions of NT (nose tackle), K (kicker), and LS (long snapper), because those positions are not considered in our testing data, we can drop those positions.  The model that was put forth in this notebook was a position neutral model.  We dropped the year, name, college, and position to test our features.  For future model testing, it is imperaitve that we use the same seed and test_sizes for all models.  Later on, we will go over the many different parameters that we will tune, but for now, let's get our first predictions.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph">We will use the data from the data folder called <a href="https://github.com/steveThomasTri/2019NFLDraftProject/blob/master/data/2019TestingData.csv">2019Testingdata.csv</a></p>
